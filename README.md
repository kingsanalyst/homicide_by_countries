# homicide_by_countries

Homicide by countries, this is a full data analysis project using python library called pandas, matplotlib, plotly and seaborn.
I imported the libraries that are needed for this project which are;

•	Pandas

•	Matplotlib

•	Plotly

•	Seaborn 

I imported the dataset to my Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization.
I cleaned the data using python code and the data types.
•	I extracted the top 5 rows from the dataframe base on the count column and I calculated the percentage of each column value related to the sum count values, I sorted some columns such as the count and location in the visualization (Pie Chart).

•	I sum the count column base on year and region in the visualization (Bar Chart).

•	I filter the dataset by region (Asia and Europe) that is greater than the year 2016 in the visualization (Line chart).

•	I created a dataframe column by year column and sum the rate values from the dataset in the visualization (Bar Chart).

•	I grouped the dataframe by the “Subregion” column and find the average count value within each subregion and return the Treemap in the visualization (Treemap).
